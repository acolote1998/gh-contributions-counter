## üë• Users

The list of tracked users is defined in `userList.json`

An example file is provided as `userList.json.example` which you can and use as a template

The user list has the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    ghId: "user123",
    name: "Aki",
  },
  {
    ghId: "user456",
    name: "John",
  },
];
```

To add a new GitHub user, append a new object to the JSON array with their GitHub login ID (ghId) and the display name you want to see in the report.

For example:

```json
{
  "ghId": "user123",
  "name": "Aki"
}
```
